## Notes you can paste under the table in GitHub

* **SPI (CAN / MCP2515)** uses D10–D13; don’t reuse these for anything else.
* **I²C** uses **A4/A5**; if colour sensor is enabled, those pins are reserved.
* **PTT is priority**: D7 (PTT OUT) should remain dedicated.
* **D2** is reserved for **CAN INT** (recommended for fast RX servicing).
* **D0/D1** are left for serial debug; avoid using them for sensors unless you’re sure you won’t need Serial.

If you want, I can also generate a matching `#define` block for Module2 that exactly matches this table (so the table and code never drift).
